Similarity Exercise

Approach:
2 sets with CIDRs are checked for similarity in this program.

An IP range is obtained from each CIDR.

2 CIDRs are compared for the relation of "contains","intersect","none" or "adjacent" by passing the low and high IP addresses of CIDR.

Once the comparison is finished, the mxn matrix is updated to hold the values "contains","contained in","intersect","none" or "adjacent".
Where m and n is the number of elements in set1 and set2 respectively.
