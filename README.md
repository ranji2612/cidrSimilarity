Similarity Exercise
Overview
Use a programming language of your choice to implement a data analysis algorithm.
We realize that doing this assignment may require you to learn new technologies. A lot of what our team does on a daily basis involves learning new technologies, concepts and techniques and applying them to our product. This assignment is designed to demonstrate that you can write code that performs analysis on a well defined set of data. Do your best and donâ€™t give up.


Assignment
1.Read and understand the CIDR notation - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation
2.Assume you're given n sets of CIDR blocks. For example {10.10.0.0/16, 10.20.0.0/16, 192.168.5.0/24} and {10.0.0.0/8,
192.168.5.127/25}.
3.Return a matrix, which indicates the degree of interaction between the sets, for example the first two in the first block, are contained
within the first element of the second block.
4.The algorithm needs to offer speed over precision, we want to know if two set are intersecting, contained, adjacent or none rather than if they intersect at 95.6%.
5.Suggest a method to present the data. For example, a venn diagram http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram. Explain why you chose
this option and its limitations.
6.Preferred languages are java or Javascript (using node.js as a runtime). If you chose to use a different environment please explain why.
